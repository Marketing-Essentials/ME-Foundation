<h2 id="asuperstripped-downwordpressstarterthemefordevelopers.">A super stripped-down WordPress starter theme for developers on the Marketing Essentials team.</h2>


<h3 id="⭐️whyplate">⭐️ Why Plate?</h3>

<p>We love Plate because it is literally a blank platform upon which you can build your own custom WordPress theme(s). There&#8217;s no bloat or unnecessary fluff that comes with many pre-built themes so you can add in what you need and remove what you don&#8217;t. Yet, it comes with some smart defaults that facilitate getting your project up and running quickly: CSS Reset, modular scss, typography, a user agent detection script, page slug body classes, built in page-navi, template parts and custom page/archive/taxonomy templates.</p>

<p>Plate evolved out of the amazing <a href="https://themble.com/bones/">Bones</a> starter theme by Eddie Machado. We first started with Bones in 2011 after looking at every starter theme out there and subsequently used it on hundreds of projects. What made Bones unique was Eddie&#8217;s exquisite comments throughout the theme. The Bones GitHub page is now gone (I has a sad) but I&#8217;ve uploaded an older version of Bones here if you want to check it out: <a href="https://studio.bio/docs/bones-theme.zip">Bones theme</a>.</p>

<p>We now use Plate for every single WordPress project so it is important to keep it up-to-date with the latest WordPress releases. Thus we have added support for Gutenberg, Flexbox, CSS Grid, schema, WooCommerce and more. Two years on from Bones, Plate includes more page templates, an updated default font stack, a custom post type plugin template, and some handy custom functions that we use all of the time.</p>


<p><strong>Should I update Plate with existing projects?</strong><br />
In short, no. Each version of Plate should be viewed as a moment in time. Future updates may work differently or break your theme. Once you&#8217;ve included a particular version in your project, stick with that version or use a newer version as a separate theme. This is how Bones worked and we decided to keep this strategy when updating so that Plate can evolve over time without worrying about backwards compatibility. You can always download a previous version of Plate from the <a href="https://github.com/joshuaiz/plate/releases">Releases page</a>.</p>
